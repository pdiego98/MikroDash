	// from the Devices page, the routers API and startup — never from here — so
	// selecting a router left the pool holding it as well.
	//
	// TWO system collectors then fed ONE evaluator, and they disagree about
	// `updateAvailable`: the rule fires on available-with-a-version and resolves
	// on not-available, so the two sources alternated. MEASURED: 50
	// `routeros_update` rows in 24 hours on the active router, against ZERO in
	// the live app's database over the same period, most of them already
	// resolved — a fire/resolve pair every time the two polls disagreed.
	//
	// It also means two connections and two sets of collectors on the one router
	// anybody is actually looking at.

	// sockets'". So opening the Devices page once and navigating away leaves a
	// connection to EVERY router, and selecting one then adds a second to it
	// that never goes away: a permanent extra `/user/active` entry on the one
	// router the operator is actually looking at.
	//
	// `Drop`, NOT `syncPool`. This was written as `syncPool()` first and that is
	// a fleet-wide dial: `SyncPool` starts every router that is neither excluded
	// nor already tracked (routers/overview.go:69-74), and on a process where
	// nobody has opened Devices `tracked` is empty -- so a socket handler would
	// have connected to every router in the fleet to fix one duplicate.

	// This used to hand the retiring alert pool's per-second `traffic` and `ping`
	// rings to the Session that displaced it. The two GRAPHS are the one thing
	// `Last()` replay cannot serve: every other card is a reading and replays
	// whole, but a chart is a WINDOW, and a window that starts empty grows from a
	// single point over a minute. The operator's requirement is that no page
	// waits, so the window had to be handed over rather than re-earned.
	//
	// Phase 4.3 removed the hand-over by removing the second session. A router
	// with reporting on is HELD by `session.Manager` for the history reason, so
	// `traffic` and `ping` have been running on THIS session all along; acquiring
	// it as a viewer adds a reference and changes nothing about the rings. There
	// is no other object holding the samples, so there is nothing to copy.

//     the collector itself uses to decide what to stream. Validating the
//     server's own configuration against the router adds no safety.
//
//  2. AT ATTACH TIME THERE IS NOTHING TO VALIDATE AGAINST. `trafficSelect` feeds
//     `SetAvailable` from `IfStatus().Last()`, and on a fresh attach the status
//     collector has not produced a reading yet — so `NormalizeIfName` refuses,
//     the function returns early, and no room is joined. That is exactly what

// says nothing about whether a DASHBOARD CARD fed by the same collector is still
// being watched — a distinction that cost four separate fixes (dhcpNetworks,
// bandwidth, vpn, firewall) and a fifth for routing.
//
// `suspendConnsIfIdle` was its one specialisation: two pages and a card share the
// connection-table read, so neither page's blur could suspend it alone. That one
// carried the sharpest scar in the file — it listed the two page rooms and NOT
// `dash-card-connections`, so returning to the dashboard from either page
// suspended the collector with a viewer still watching the card, and the audit
// written for exactly this defect class could not see it because it only
// inspected DIRECT suspends.
//
// Every one of those bugs is the same shape: a hand-written answer to "who else
// is watching this collector". `applyDemand` asks `collect.DemandRooms` instead,
