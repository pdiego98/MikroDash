// The events whose payload is a Go MAP, typed by hand.
//
// Every other event's payload is a Go struct, and its type is generated into
// gen/payloads.ts by cmd/tsgen. These are the ones Go builds as
// `map[string]any` — mostly replies to a request, like `packages:ok` or
// `res:error` — so there is no struct to generate from. Each type here is read
// off the Go that builds it: every send site, with a key that only some of
// them set marked optional.
//
// ── IT CANNOT FALL OUT OF STEP WITH THE LIST ────────────────────────────────
//
// HandEventName is generated: exactly the events Go declares with a map
// payload. The check at the bottom fails tsc, naming the events, if this file
// misses one or types one that is not a map event — so an event added in Go,
// or moved from a map to a struct, is a compile error here rather than a
// silent gap.
//
// What it cannot check is the KEYS, which are read from the Go by hand. So a Go
// struct that a map carries is IMPORTED from gen/payloads.ts, never restated —
// cmd/tsgen's `extraRoots` exists to generate the ones no declaration reaches.
//
// ── TWO DISAGREEMENTS, RECORDED RATHER THAN RESOLVED ────────────────────────
//
// `res:ok`'s `movedId` is a string from a move and null from undo/redo, and
// `wifiscan:error`'s `scanId` is null from a refused start and a string from a
// failed scan. The types say exactly that. Making the Go agree is a behaviour
// change, not a typing one.
